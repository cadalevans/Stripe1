good.morning.message=Building a Google DialogFlow Chatbot.üòç\
  Chatbots have become extremely popular in recent years and their use in the e-commerce industry has skyrocketed. They have found a strong foothold in almost every task that requires text-based public dealing. They have become so critical with customer support, for example that almost 25% of all customer service operations are expected to use them by the end of 2020.\
  Building a comprehensive and production-ready chatbot from scratch, however, is an almost impossible task. Tech companies like Google and Amazon have been able to achieve this feat after spending years and billions of dollars in research, something that not everyone with a use for a chatbot can afford.\
  Luckily, almost every player in the tech market (including Google and Amazon) allows businesses to purchase their technology platforms to design customized chatbots for their own use. These platforms have pre-trained language models and easy-to-use interfaces that make it extremely easy for new users to set up and deploy customized chatbots in no time. In the previous blogs in our series on chatbots, we talked about how to build AI and rule based chatbots in Python. In this blog, we?ll be taking you through how to build a simple AI chatbot using Google?s DialogFlow:\

Agents\
An Agent is what DialogFlow calls your chatbot. A DialogFlow Agent is a trained generative machine learning model that understands natural language flows and the nuances of human conversations. DialogFlow translates input text during a conversation to structured data that your apps and services can understand. \
Intents\
Intents are the starting point of a conversation in DialogFlow. When a user starts a conversation with a chatbot, DialogFlow matches the input to the best intent available. A chatbot can have as many intents as required depending on the level of conversational detail a user wants the bot to have. Each intent has the following parameters:
